== Embedding the script ==

  * Link to embed.js as an external script, wither on your own server or on our project at http://jspackcrx.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/embed.js for the latest version.
  * You may choose to load the script asynchronously, but if your script runs immediately it should be synchronous.

== How to use JSPackCrx ==

JSPackCrx's API closely resembles that of [http://jszip.stuartk.co.uk/ JSZip's], because it is based on the code. The only differences is that JSPackCrx somewhat validates manifests and packages files in the crx format.

=== new JSCrx([compressionMethod,validateManifests]) ===
Creates a new crx file.
  * `compressionMethod` The compression method to use.
    Available methods:
      * `STORE` no compression, the default.
      * `DEFLATE` default zip compression. Deflate algorithm will be loaded as needed.
  * `validateManifests` Toggles validating manifests. Defaults to true.
