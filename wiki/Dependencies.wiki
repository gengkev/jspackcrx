#summary The other libraries/dependencies that jspackcrx has

= Introduction =

hi! here's a nice list of the other libraries that jspackcrx depends on. Though it loads these in its worker so yeah.


= Details =

Core library:
  * [http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/ jsbn] (modified) A really big part of what happens in the library, I rewrote a large portion of it to remove global scope pollution but I might just stick it in a closure
    * Instead of using its RNG library I just switched it to a simple `Math.random()` call, which is cryptographically secure in WebKit
  * [http://www9.atwiki.jp/kurushima/pub/jsrsa/ RSA-Sign] (modified) Maybe not exactly good JS practice either, but hey, it's implemented, and I'm too lazy to write it myself :c
  * [http://antimatter15.com/wp/2010/01/javascript-sha1-and-sha256-in-1-kb/ antimatter15's SHA1] / [https://gist.github.com/267720 gist] Well, it's good it doesn't have UTF-8 encoding which is what caused jshash to not work

Demo page:
  * [https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js FileSaver.js] for downloading files, since assigning a location to a data URI did not work :(
  * [http://jszip.stuartk.co.uk/ JSZip] for creating zip files in js, a big part of the original idea

More credits and stuff:
  * [http://lapo.it/asn1js/ asn1js] for decoding all of that asn.1 stuff
  * [http://home.paulschou.net/tools/xlate/ Binary Translator] since I'm too lazy to write one myself
  * [http://blog.roomanna.com/12-12-2010/packaging-chrome-extensions Packaging Chrome Extensions] / [https://github.com/kurrik/chrome-extensions/tree/master/crx-appengine-packager crx-appengine-packager] Really, REALLY useful reference for messing with the crx format!
  * [https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/ pycrypto] for some baseline code and confusing me
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm) Wikipedia] yeah
  * [http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/crx.html The Chrome CRX reference] where all knowledge must come from
  * [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2313 All of] [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3279 these] [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280 RFCs!!!] which are confusing but necessary
  * [http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/rsa.html OpenSSL] for testing and stuff
